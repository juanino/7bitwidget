Overview 
========

The 7 bit widget is a program for the raspberry pi that allows you to define functions that have 7 bit answers represented
as 7 leds and use a two button selector to select programs to run.

The output of the program is always a number from 0-127 so if you are representing temperature or something numeric
this is easy.  If you are not representing a number, you need to print a cheat sheet and refer to that for the answers.
A good example of this is the magic 8 ball program which answers with one of 20 answers from the classic toy 
which can be found on wikipedia. 

What does it look like
======================
Look in the images directory for a sample layout for the project. It is just a bunch of LEDs each with a resistor put on 
perf board and pushed through some holes in a piece of cardboard shaped like a mini computer.
