Overview

The 7 bit widget is a program for the raspberry pi that allows you to define functions that have 7 bit answers represented
as 7 leds and use a two button select to select programs to run.

The output of the program is always a number from 0-127 so if you are representing temperature or something numeric
this is easy.  If you are not representing a number, you need to print a cheat sheet and refer to that for the answers.
A good example of this is the magic 8 ball program which answers answers with one of 20 answers from the classic toy 
which can be found on wikipedia.
